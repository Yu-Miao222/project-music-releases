# Music Releases

This project is a music app consisting of newly released albums and singles, built using React. It was done in pairs (in collaboration with Yu Miao) using Spotify data.
We followed a specific design given to  us and reached our goals.

## The problem

We started off by thinking about the layout of the album and sketching the components that we would be using. Then we created components to make full use of what React has to offer, and thus making our components reusable. The app is responsive so we started with the "mobile first" approach.
We added features such as a collection of popular playlists, the play button shows and grows when the user hovers over it. The site is also divided into new albums and singles. And we dabbled in a bit of useState in React to toggle the appearance of the playlists in mobile view.
